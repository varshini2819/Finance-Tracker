                         (Front-end)

                        Google Sheets
                        (Data Storage)

                           Power-Bi
                     (Data Visualization)

The workflow of project is step by step process i.e,first we will get a dashboard displaying 4 cards they are 
1.Income page-To enter income by categorising the income.
2.Expense page-To enter expenses by categorizing the income.
3.Savings page-To enter savings amount by categorizing.
4.Power-Bi dashboard-To visualize the project.

Next their is a monthly budget option we need to enter our amount that is used to check and notify us when we exceed 80% of the monthly budget.

The notification is sent via Twilio API.
